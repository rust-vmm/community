# rust-vmm gate keeping

Together with repository code owners, the gate keepers team's main role is to
manage rust-vmm contributions. In particular, gate keepers will make sure that
PRs get addressed, reviewed and eventually merged in a reasonable time frame.

For that purpose, gate keepers may get assigned as PR reviewers when a rust-vmm
repository is lacking code owners, or when a previously assigned reviewer is not
able to review a pending PR.

Gate keepers have write access to all rust-vmm repositories and can merge PRs
whenever they pass all CI tests and have received at least 2 reviewer approvals.
