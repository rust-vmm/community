## How to contribute?

### Adding a new crate to rust-vmm

Each rust-vmm crate lives in its own repo under the [rust-vmm organization](http://github.com/rust-vmm).
If you want to contribute to rust-vmm by adding a new Rust crate to the project, you will have to go through the following steps:

1. Submit a [crate addition request](https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-crate-request.md&title=Crate+Addition).
2. The crate relevance to the project will be discussed through the issue submitted in step 1.
3. If the crate gets accepted by the project maintainers, a new, empty repository will be created under the rust-vmm repository.
4. Submit a pull request to the newly created repository as your initial code submission.
