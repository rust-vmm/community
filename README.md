## What Is rust-vmm?

rust-vmm is an open-source project that empowers the community to build custom
Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) and hypervisors. It provides a set of
virtualization components that any project can use to quickly develop
virtualization solutions while focusing on the key differentiators of their
product rather than re-implementing common components like KVM wrappers, virtio
devices and other VMM libraries.

The rust-vmm project is organized as a shared effort, shared ownership
open-source project that includes (so far) contributors from Alibaba, AWS,
Cloud Base, Crowdstrike, Intel, Google, Red Hat as well as individual
contributors.

Each virtualization component lives in a separate GitHub repository under the
rust-vmm organization. One repository corresponds usually to one
[Rust crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html).

## Why rust-vmm?

- **Reduce code duplication**. The initial idea behind rust-vmm was to create
  a place for sharing common virtualization components between two existing
  VMMs written in Rust:
  [CrosVM](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/) and
  [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/). These
  two projects have similar code for calling KVM ioctls, managing the
  virtual machine memory, interacting with virtio devices and others. Instead
  of having these components live in each of the projects repositories, they
  can be shared through the rust-vmm project. Since the beginning of the
  project, other initiatives have enabled expanding the scope of the project
  to accommodate the needs of other hypervisors (Xen and Hyper-v), and
  various open source projects such as
  [Cloud Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor),
  and the [Qemu virtiofsd implementation](https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd).
- **Faster development**. rust-vmm provides a base of virtualization components
  which are meant to be generic such that they can be consumed by multiple
  projects. The project aims to allow building custom virtualization solutions
  by reusing the rust-vmm components. On top of these components, a custom
  solution should only need to care about its specialized component, an API
  and the glue code that provides the interactions between them.
- **Security & Testability**. One of the most salient feature of rust-vmm is
  its high quality components. We want to keep a high quality standard
  as these virtualization packages are used in production by multiple projects.
  Each component is individually tested with a set of common build time tests
  responsible for running unit tests, linters (including coding style
  checks), and computing the coverage. For critical components that handle
  untrusted input we also run fuzzing
  (i.e in [vm-virtio](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio)), and provide a
  [threat model documentation](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-superio#threat-model)
  that customers can use to improve the security of their solutions.
- **Clean interface**. As crates are shared between multiple VMMs, the reviews
  for interface changes will typically go through a few rounds of reviews to
  make sure they are flexible enough to be used by multiple products.

## The rust-vmm components

When we first started the rust-vmm project each of the crate was living in
its own repository. As the number of crates grew quickly, we reverted this
decision, and started having related crates as part of a single workspace. Now,
we have one workspace per repository. For example, the vm-virtio repository
accommodates multiple crates including virtio-queue, and different virtio
device implementations. The reasoning behind having multiple crates in a
single repository comes from the maintenance cost of repositories. To give an
example, whenever we update the rust-vmm-ci,
[Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/)
will open a PR in each rust-vmm repository to update to the latest version.
While in most cases the reviews are trivial as very few changes are required,
you still need to go through a long list of PRs that need to be approved. In
rare cases when changes to the infrastructure impact the CI, propagating them
to individual repositories quickly adds up. You need to clone the repository,
create a branch, provide the update, follow up on the PRs, and so on.

A rust-vmm crate can have one of the following states:

1. `empty`: The crate repo exists but there is no code there yet. This
   means the crate was created after a community acknowledgement about its
   relevance to the project, but either no code has been submitted yet or
   the initial code base is being reviewed through a pull request.

1. `rust-vmm`: The code is a work in progress. Once it meets the production
   [requirements](#publishing-on-cratesio---requirements-list), the crate
   will be pushed to [crates.io](https://crates.io).

1. `crates.io`: The crate is considered to be production ready. It can be
   consumed from Rust's canonical crate registry:
   [crates.io](https://crates.io). The crate repository in rust-vmm
   is as a staging area until the next push to [crates.io](https://crates.io).
   In other words, the production ready version of the code lives in
   [crates.io](https://crates.io) while development happens in the rust-vmm
   git repo.

## Development

### Maintainers and Gatekeepers

The rust-vmm project is maintained by repository maintainers and gatekeepers. More details about
their responsibilities are available in the [Maintainers Docs](MAINTAINERS.md).

### Community Channels

You can join our community discussions on any of the following places:

* Join our
  [mailing list](http://lists.opendev.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rust-vmm).
* Join our
  [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/rust-vmm/shared_invite/enQtODAxMzA2ODIyMTc2LWRhYjIwZmQ0YzUxODJlMTRhZWU2ZDBjYmJiNzBmOWVmYjg4MjY5YWRjYjM0YzQ5YzgyMTBmYzNlMjMzYmZlODU).

### Contributing Guidelines

All the rust-vmm repositories accept contributions by a
[GitHub Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
For more details, please check the [contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For other processes (like setting up repos), please check the
[extended documentation](docs).

If you want to become a rust-vmm maintainer, or you're curious about the role,
please check the documentation available in [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md).

### Adding a New Virtualization Component

If you have a proposal about a new rust-vmm component, please open a
[review request issue](https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-crate-request.md&title=Crate+Addition+Request).
The issue must provide the explanations and justifications behind the need for
a new component, highlighting the purpose of this new repository, how will it
be used by other VMMs or hypervisors, and other information that you find
relevant.

Discussions about the proposal will take place on the same issue, and once an
agreement is reached on the new crate name (this part is hard!) and design,
an empty repository will be created in the rust-vmm GitHub organization.

To add functionality you will need to send Pull Requests (PRs) against the
newly created repository. While we do not expect the code to be perfect from
the first try, we do enforce a high standard in terms of quality for all
existing repositories under rust-vmm.

### Publishing on crates.io - Requirements List

We consider crates published on [crates.io](https://crates.io) to be production
ready. In order to maintain a high security and quality standard, the following
list of requirements must be checked before having the first version published:

- **High level documentation**. This documentation should be added
  to `src/lib.rs` and it will end up being the home page of the crate on
  [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/). Include information about what this crate does,
  how can it be used in other projects, as well as usage examples. Check out
  the [kvm-ioctls docs](https://docs.rs/kvm-ioctls/0.1.0/kvm_ioctls/) for an
  example.
- **Documentation for the public interface**. Everything belonging to the
  public interface of the crate must be properly documented. Where applicable,
  the methods should also have
  [usage examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments).
  The code examples are particularly useful because they are run on
  `cargo test`. It is a nice way to ensure that your comments and examples
  don't go out of sync with the code. To make sure we don't miss anything this
  rule is enforceable by using `#![deny(missing-docs)]` in `src/lib.rs`.
- **Unit Tests**.
- **Coverage**. We expect all crates to have coverage tests that don't allow
  the coverage to drop on new PRs. See [the coverage docs](docs/maintainers/code_coverage.md) for more details.
- **Build Time Tests**. All components will eventually be tested using the
  same common [Buildkite pipeline](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines). This
  is still WIP. The tests include style checks and other lint checks, a
  coverage test, builds with various configurations and on different
  architectures and operating systems.
- **README.md**. The readme contains high-level information about the crate.
  The readme is the front page of the package on crates.io so ideally it also
  has minimal examples on how to use the crate.
  For in-depth design details, a DESIGN.md file can be created.
- **LICENSE**.
- **CODEOWNERS**.
- **Complete `Cargo.toml`**. Check the
  [`cargo` reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html#before-publishing-a-new-crate)
  for the **requirements** that a crate must meet to be published to
  [crates.io](https://crates.io).

### CI

We ensure that all rust-vmm components keep the same quality bar by using the
[rust-vmm-ci](https://github.com/rust-vmm/rust-vmm-ci/). The rust-vmm-ci is
built on top of [Buildkite](http://buildkite.com/), and added as a submodule
to all rust-vmm repositories. For more details, please check the [rust-vmm-ci
README](https://github.com/rust-vmm/rust-vmm-ci/).
