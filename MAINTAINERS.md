# rust-vmm maintainers

In rust-vmm we have two types of maintainers:
- [gatekeepers](#gatekeepers), that have admin permissions over all rust-vmm
  repositories, and are responsible for the general health of the project.
- repository maintainer, that have admin permissions and are responsible for
  the health of one or more rust-vmm repositories.

Note that we do not have a process for removing maintainers and gatekeepers.
This means that not all the people mentioned in this document might still be
active in the project.

## Repository Maintainer

As a repository maintainer you have the following responsibilities:
- review PRs coming from the open source community
- respond to issues/questions
- review the dependabot PRs and fix any problems that generated by updates in
  rust-vmm-ci (typically clippy fixes are required when updating the Rust
  version) or other dependencies
- [updating the rust-vmm-ci manually](CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-the-rust-vmm-ci)
  when updates are needed before the dependabot scheduled time.
- make sure that the
  [quality guidelines](README.md#publishing-on-cratesio---requirements-list)
  are followed before publishing a new crate or a new version.
- follow the [crate release process](docs/maintainers/crate_release.md) for
  publishing new crate versions

The repository maintainers are mentioned in the `CODEOWNERS` file of all
rust-vmm repositories.

### Becoming a Repository Maintainer

As the project is evolving we are looking to add repository maintainers. We
encourage people to first ramp up on the repositories by going through the
documentation, looking at issues, review and submit pull requests. Even though
you initially do not have write permissions for the repository, reviews are a
great way to get familiar with the code.

Once you feel confident about the code in the repository, you can become a
maintainer using the following guidelines:

1. To be a code owner, open a PR in the target repository, edit the `CODEOWNERS`
file and add your GitHub handle there. In case you want to add someone else as
a code owner, open a PR in the target repository, add their GitHub handle in
the `CODEOWNERS` file, and ask that person to formally approve the PR as
acknowledgement that they agree with the role.
2. Irrespective of who created the PR, all existing code owners (as defined in
the`CODEOWNERS` file) must approve the PR before it is merged. In case
there are no code owners in the repository, ask [2 gatekeepers](#gatekeepers)
to approve the PR for you.
3. Once the PR is merged, ask one of the existing code owners to grant you
admin permissions to the repository following the
[GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization#adding-outside-collaborators-to-a-repository).
Note that maintainers can also be granted Admin rights, if they need
permissions to update the repository settings (such as adding a member).

## The Gatekeeper Role

Together with repository code owners, the gatekeepers team's main role is to
manage rust-vmm contributions. In particular, gatekeepers will make sure that
PRs get addressed, reviewed and eventually merged in a reasonable time frame.

For that purpose, gatekeepers may get assigned as PR reviewers when a rust-vmm
repository is lacking code owners, or when a previously assigned reviewer is not
able to review a pending PR.

Since we started the rust-vmm project the gatekeeper role has not been extended
to new users (with a single exception). Having a global overview of the project
when there are 20+ crates is not a feasible task. This is the reason why we are
instead encouraging people to
[become repository maintainers instead](#becoming-a-repository-maintainer).
